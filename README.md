## About

This Starter is compatible with Maizzle versions prior to `v1.0.0`, when the Nunjucks templating engine was being used.

It's archived as a convenience for anyone who wants (or needs) to keep using `v0.9.1`.

## Installation

```bash
maizzle new https://github.com/maizzle/starter-nunjucks.git
```

Alternatively, with the latest version of the [CLI](https://github.com/maizzle/cli), you can just `maizzle new` and specify you want to use a custom starter:
